/**
 * A harness adapter compiles the one policy into ONE harness's native wiring.
 * The policy knows nothing about harnesses; adapters own all harness-specific
 * knowledge. Adding a harness = adding an adapter, never touching the core.
 *
 * Contract rules every adapter must honor:
 * - wire() is idempotent: running it twice leaves one clean installation.
 * - unwire() removes exactly what wire() added, nothing else.
 * - wire() backs up any user config file before modifying it.
 * - verify() checks the wiring is PRESENT; it must not depend on network.
