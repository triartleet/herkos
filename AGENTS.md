Operating contract for AI agents working in **herkos**.

## What this project is

A security tool that enforces a user's "never-list" — the actions an agent must
never take on their machine (read credentials, run fetched code) — by compiling
one policy into each installed agent harness's native wiring. Published publicly
(MIT).

## Working rules

- **The enforcement path depends on nothing.** The deployed hook is a
  self-contained shell script that needs no network and not this package to run.
  Never introduce a runtime dependency into the enforcement path. A separate
  checker may make _verification_ richer, but enforcement must always stand
  alone.
- **The baseline never-list is curated, not padded.** A false positive in a
  default rule trains users to disable the guard — worse than no guard. New
  baseline rules must be near-universally never-legitimate. Grow the list slowly.
- **Degrade loudly, never fail closed silently.** If the hook cannot parse its
  input it announces that enforcement is off for that call and allows it (a hard
  block on every malformed call bricks the session); it never silently permits a
  matched never-list action.
- **Honesty about coverage is the product.** Where a harness cannot enforce the
  fine-grained never-list (e.g. Codex has no per-call hook), say so plainly in
  output and docs. Never imply a guarantee the harness can't keep.
- **The policy is harness-agnostic; adapters own all harness specifics.** Adding
  a harness is a new adapter, never a change to the policy model or the core.
- **Adapters are reversible and idempotent.** `wire` backs up before it edits and
  can run twice cleanly; `unwire` removes exactly what `wire` added.
- **Never commit or push unasked.** The maintainer drives version control;
  commits stay unattributed (no co-author / generated-with trailers).
- **Public repo.** Commit author is the identity in local git config. Publishing
  exposes ALL history, so no tracked file or commit message may carry absolute
  paths, hostnames or machine detail, workplace or third-party identifiers,
  credential material, references to the maintainer's other work, or internal
  provenance.

## Layout

- `src/policy.ts` — the policy model + the curated baseline never-list + compiler.
- `src/adapters/` — one module per harness (`claude-code.ts`, `codex.ts`) behind
  a shared `HarnessAdapter` interface; `index.ts` is the registry.
- `src/selfcheck.ts` — the built-in battery that runs the generated hook against
  synthetic payloads (enforcement proven without the harness).
- `src/cli.ts` — the `herkos` command; `src/index.ts` — the public API.

## Done =

- `npm test` passes (incl. the self-check); `npm run typecheck` clean; build OK.
- No machine-specific paths or identifiers in tracked files.
